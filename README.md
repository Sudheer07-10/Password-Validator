# Password-Validator
* **This Activity is used to Check passwords.**
* *To Check the validity Password*
1. The first line of the code checks if the length of the password is less than 8. If it is, the program prints an error message and continues to the next iteration of the loop.
2. If the length is not less than 8, the program checks if the password contains at least one lowercase letter. If it does not, it prints an error message and continues to the next iteration of the loop.
3. If the password does not contain at least one lowercase letter, the program checks if it contains at least one uppercase letter. If it does not, it prints an error message and continues to the next iteration of the loop.
4. If the password does not contain at least one uppercase letter, the program checks if it contains at least one number. If it does not, it prints an error message and continues to the next iteration of the loop.
5. If the password does not contain at least one number, the program checks if it contains at least one of the symbols _, @, or $. If it does not, it prints an error message and continues to the next iteration of the loop.
6. If the password contains any of the symbols _, @, or $, the program checks if it contains any spaces. If it does, the program prints an error message and continues to the next iteration of the loop.
7. If the password does not contain any spaces, the program prints a success message and breaks out of the loop.
